      for grades once the user enters a negative number.
    - write a function that sorts the grades entered
    - write a function that outputs the statistics of the grade list.  Each
      statistic should be its own function.
        - 5 highest grades (use same function to print the 5 as array)
        - 5 lowest grades (use same function to print the 5 as array)
        - average grade
        - median grade 
        - standard deviation and variance of the grades
