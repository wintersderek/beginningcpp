## Things Learned
* How to define parameterized function templats that generate a family of releated functions
* That parameters to function templates re mostly, but not always, types.
* That template arguments are mostly deduced by the compiler and how to specify them explicityly when necessary.
* How to specialize and overload function templates if the generic function definition provided by the template isn't suited for certain types.
* Why return type deduction is really powerful in combination with templates
* What the decltype keyword does.
