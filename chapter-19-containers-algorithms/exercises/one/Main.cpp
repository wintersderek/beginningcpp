/*
Exercise 19-1. In practice, we would never recommend you to implement your own 
    linked list data structure to store Boxes in Truckload. At the time it made 
    perfect sense to practice nested classes, as well as working with pointers; 
    but normally you should follow our advice from earlier in this chapter and 
    simply use a vector<> instead (a polymorphic vector<>, to be precise â€” see
    Chapter 14). If you need a sequence container, a vector<> is almost always 
    the way to go!  Eliminate the linked list from the Truckload class of 
    Exercise 17-1 according to this guideline.  Notice how you can now adhere 
    to the rule of zero as well (see Chapter 18)?
